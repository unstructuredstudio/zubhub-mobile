# Intro

ZubHub is a free web platform that expands access to low-cost creative learning and collaboration opportunities globally to children in underserved communities.

It is available for custom use for your school, library, hackerspace, or educational organization. It can be hosted in low or no internet bandwidth locations to create a small virtual hub. These hubs can be interconnected to form an extensive distributed creative education network. You can think of it as [Mastodon](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)>) social network but specifically intended for showcasing and collaborating on creative educational projects. Or maybe like [Hackaday.io](https://hackaday.io/), but for children :smiley:
